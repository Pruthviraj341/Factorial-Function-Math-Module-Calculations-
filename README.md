📘 Python Programs – Factorial & Math Module Calculations

This repository contains two Python programs demonstrating the use of functions, loops, and the math module.

🚀 Task 1: Factorial Using a Function
📌 Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

Defines a function factorial to calculate the factorial of an integer using a loop.

Allows the user to enter any integer.

If the number is negative → factorial is not defined.

If the number is positive → factorial is calculated.

Keeps asking for new inputs until the user enters 0 to exit.

📝 Sample Run
Enter an integer (type 0 to exit): 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120

Enter an integer (type 0 to exit): -3
Factorial is not defined for negative integer -3.

Enter an integer (type 0 to exit): 0
Exiting program. Goodbye!
🚀 Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
📌 Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

Asks the user for a number.

Uses the math module to calculate:

Square root of the number

Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number

Sine of the number (in radians)

Displays the results.

📝 Sample Run
Enter a number: 5

--- Results ---
Square root of 5 = 2.23606797749979
Natural log of 5 = 1.6094379124341003
Sine of 5 (radians) = -0.9589242746631385
